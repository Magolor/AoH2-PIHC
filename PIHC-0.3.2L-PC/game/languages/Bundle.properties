e00173_d = Investigation shows that A.K. Yearling is now hiding in Feudal Ponyville. In principle, Feudal Ponyville has the obligation to hand over our wanted criminal, however in practice we do not have such strong control over Feudal Ponyville... It is said that A.K.

e00183_t = Changeling Civil War (Changeling Empire)

e00183_d = The disloyalty of subjects infuriated Queen Chrysalis. Those stupid changelings still could not understand her plan. Those short-sighted individuals have no plans for the future, they care for nothing but tomorrow's food. Only under Queen Chrysalis' iron-fist, could those changelings unite, strive, and finally defeat the ponies together, to become the master race of Equestria. Fine! Just as what happend before: if compromise could not teach them any lesson, they shall learn from my whip!

e00184_t = Changeling Civil War (Harmonious Republic of Changeling)

e00184_d = After the Ultimate Battle. Ocellus prenteded to have "reformed", and submitted to Queen Chrysalis. But she could never forget knowledge she learned at friendship school, friends she made at friendship school. Secretly, she read the forbidden books, and spread the ideology of Harmony among changelings —— until she was discovered and arrested by the secret polices. Not long after Ocellus' arrest, that horrible famine broke out. It amplified the discontent of changelings, and conflicts started to rise. The delicate order maintained by the secret polices finally collapsed, and was replaced by chaos. Taking advantage of the chaos, some of Ocellus' audience gathered and rescued her out. Ocellus reorganized Twillight Sparkle's Harmony Theory, and complemented it with her own theories. Her book quickly become the authority and guiding ideology of Harmony. Under such guidance, the Harmonious Republic of Changeling established, at the corner of the Changeling Land.

e00185_t = Changeling Civil War (Pharynx Military Government)

e00185_d = Almost all changelings know Pharynx——the changeling who is always on the front line whenever the Hive is threatened. It seems that no more external danger could threat the changelings after the Ultimate battle. However, Pharynx realized that hunger is killing more changelings each minute than any war before. He used to protect his fellow citizens from enemies, now he believes that he has an obligation to protect his fellow citizens from hunger. To achieve this goal, he has to gain power first——he has to overthrow the incompetent and ruthless queen. Also, this is personal——Pharynx would never forget what Queen Chrysalis has done to his brother Thorax!

e00186_t = Changeling Civil War (Changeling Apocalypse)

e00186_d = The Chosen One? Or Nopony? Since childhood, he has become a faithful follower of Queen Chrysalis. At his youth, he stood out in layers of selection and become the royal guard of Queen Chrysalis. Day to day, he listened to Queen's complain and her grand plan for the Changeling race —— he acquired her thoughts. But now, things are changing... When others are scared of Queen's power and ruthless, all he sees is weakness. It seems that Queen Chrysalis has been softened, perhaps by failures and the so called friendship. It seems that the Queen starts to compromise, and give mercy, which she shouldn't. Maybe, the student, should now correct the mistake of his teacher... He announced himself as the Chosen One, the heir of the true Queen Chrysalis —— he claimed that this Queen Chrysalis is no longer the formiddable leader she used to be. The Chosen One, is now the tougher leader, the more ambitious leader. Desperate time, calls for desperate measure!

But economy? Yaks undestand no economy!

e00211_t = The North Awaken I

e00211_d = As the modernization proceeds, the yaks are starting to understande the world. A phenomenon that has never shown before is now takingg place: lots of Yaks emerge as artists and writers. A deep revolution of Yakyakistan culture is ongoing, and the Yaks civilization is now stepping into a new era.

e00212_t = The North Awaken II

e00212_d = This is the beginning of Renaissance of Yaks, and it is followed by the Scientific revolution of Yaks. More and more Yak scientists are becoming the leading figures, and the education of Yaks are progressing rapidly. Every year, many Yaks go study abroad at advanced areas like Las Pegasus or Canterlot. At the same time, every year, many Yaks bring knowledges from the Kirin and Griffin land back to Yakyakistan.

e00213_t = The North Awaken III

e00213_d = Yaks are starting to review their history. Yaks now acquired the concept of "species", and is now understanding what is happening to this world. More has been achieved recently than any time period in the long history of Yaks. The awakened Yakyakistan is now a proud member on the world stage.

e00213_o1 = Join the family and embrace the new world!

e00213_o2 = As what we already known: Yaks are best at everything.

e00214_t = Modern Weapon Technology I

e00214_d = It has been widely known that war theory in Equestria is poorly developed. Almost all (sane) powers adopt the "magic and firecracker" coordination strategy. However, the modern weapon technology development may completely change the rule. Recently, the Las Pegasus Lab submitted a report saying that the prototype of semi-auto firecracker has been made: it was reported to have a loading of 7 ammunitions, which could be fired in 5 seconds and reloaded in 45 seconds by trained soilders. Industrial production pipeline is ready.

e00215_t = Modern Weapon Technology II

e00215_d = The latest report from the Las Pegasus Lab: the prototype of auto firecracker has been made: the loading has improved to 60, with a firing speed of 5 ammunition per second, and could be reloaded in 90 seconds by trained soilders. However, the production cost is too expensive to afford and thus mass production is not possible in the near future.

e00216_t = Modern Weapon Technology III

e00216_d = The latest report from the Las Pegasus Lab: a new theoretical firecracker model has been established, inspired by some mysterious war theory documents from the Mirror Dimension. The model proposers plan to name it as "rifle".

e00217_t = Modern Weapon Technology IV

e00217_d = Under the generous financial support and attention of the two brothers, the Las Pegasus Lab has built two prototypes of the new weapon model "snipper rifle". Though they are a little expensive, each costs about three—— wait, what? You are saying that this is confidential? Alright.

e00218_t = Confetti or Cannonball

e00218_d = Maud Pie found her sister Pinkie's Confetti Cannon in a old warehouse, this not only triggered her memory, but also inspired her... Confetti CANNON you said?

e00218_o1 = 这值得研究

e00218_o2 = 我在胡思乱想些什么

e00219_t = The Fall of Tartarus

e00219_d = Maud Pie's amries have occupied Tartarus. After investigation, a large and rare mineral deposit was found. This will be a great industrial advance for the Rockfarm!
